we are showing the solutions to the following equation for $a=1, b=3, c=2$:

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 3
c <- 2
x <- seq(-5,5,0.1)
f <- a*x^2 + b*x + c
plot(x,f,type="l",xlab="x",ylab="f(x)")+abline(h=0,lty=2.5)
```
The intersection of the dashed line at $y=0$, is the solution(s) to the equation.


```{r}

sqrt_term = (b^2 - 4 * a * c)
solutions <- "No solutions exist"
if (sqrt_term >= 0) {
    solutions <- c((-b + sqrt(sqrt_term)) / (2 * a),
              (-b - sqrt(sqrt_term)) / (2 * a))
}
solutions
```
